Some development notes


1. You can run several versions of Firefox as follows:


Download and untar versions from Mozilla website:
http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-older.html
http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/

Start versions directly from the unzipped folder as follows:

./firefox -no-remote -P 

This brings up the profile dialog.

To use the Git development profile (called firefox.profile)


Create a new profile, --> Next --> Choose Profile folder, then navigate to the development profile 
--> Then provide a name for the profile (such as Printhint Git profile), OK


To-Do - PH installed in profile not working .....

The profile is meant to include the printhint extension (but it gets deleted sometimes by FF 3.5
(recreate file named {4ca88e02-7bbb-43fe-ae41-5103893fa10c} with text: "../../")


Older versions of Printhint are in the folder archive... please do not unzip in that folder



Some useful git commands:


ssh git@github.com (to test connection, should disconnect automatically)

git branch
git checkout master
git checkout -b testing2
git commit -am 'removed test files'
git status
git merge newbranch
git grep printversion-tooltip
git blame -- content/browserOverlay.xul
git rm -rf chrome (remove a folder)
